#Outcome Subscores: `r outcome_name`
To investigate how accurately items are assigned to outcome categories,
a series of analyses were completed to determine items' factor loadings. 

##Dataset
The dataset analyzed consisted of responses to the 2013 Comprehensive Predictor, Forms A-F, 
from test sessions that were completed between 11/15/2015 and 12/31/2015 or
04/01/2016 or 05/15/2016. All respondents were students from BSN institutions.
Pre-test items were not included. These decisions were made in order to select
a dataset that represented optimal testing conditions.

The dataset for the `r outcome_name` outcome included `r n_responses` responses to 
`r n_items` items that were tagged to the outcome.
